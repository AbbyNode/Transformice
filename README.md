# Transformice

A collection of scripts I made for [Transformice](https://www.transformice.com/) back in early 2010's

## Colour Names
Makes usernames alternate between colors

## Confettee Spawn
Spawns items using the confette emote

## Emote Display
Displays text version of emotes used

## Pull
Pulls mice and objects towards clicked point

## Zombies
Possibly the most elaborate script in here.  
Makes some mice controlled by other mice.  
Remember to change "YourUsername" fields before running.

Enjoy!
